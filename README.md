# Azure Build Agent
Dockerized Azure Build Agent with .NET 6, Terraform, and Ansible.

## Unraid Support
I'm going to write an article and publish this to the Unraid repository. If you're running this at home, installing this on an Unraid server will be extreamly easy.

## Running Locally
You can run this locally on Windows by setting these environment variables and running the `run.ps1` script.
